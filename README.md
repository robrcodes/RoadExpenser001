##Road Expenser - Prototype##

This is a test application, implemented in Meteor JS to create a fast rapid development prototype. It is not a completed application and is still far from even being what could be called Alpha stage. Final application is most likely to be developed using another JavaScript based technology.

~~[Demo](http://roadexpenser.meteor.com/) currently hosted on the Meteor test server.~~
A Demo is no longer available after 25th March 2016 due to the end of free hosting by Meteor.com (read [this](https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-com-free-hosting-ends-march-25-2016/19308) post for further info).

##Key Objectives for Prototype##

- The application will allow user login/registration with email and password.
- ‘Road Expenser’ will be accessible from any internet-connected device, running from a hosted web server and database.
- Design will be simplistic yet functional, visually focussed on mobile use for recording expenses/ road trip information.
- ‘Road Expenser’ will make use of optional GeoLocation technology to allow users to quickly add the locality to an expense record at the time of input.
- A user will be able to create multiple road trips, one after the other, with access to both the current trips expenses and previous trip records.
- User accounts will be secure and only able to access that account’s records of personal trips and related expenses.
- ‘Road Expenser’ will allow a user to export a completed trip record as a CSV file.


##Benefits

Road Expenser will have the following benefits:
* Users will be able to easily create & name new road trip records to add data to.
* Recording of trip expenses while ‘on-the-go’ will be easier with limited functionality to reduce the user inputs, without unnecessary steps required.
* Optional GeoLocation will allow users to input the locality of an expense with less key/touch inputs.
* Expense summary provided throughout a trip enables user to remain aware of ongoing expense costs related to the current trip.
* Ending a trip and accessing historical trip records will be easy, CSV export availability of each trip for reporting.
